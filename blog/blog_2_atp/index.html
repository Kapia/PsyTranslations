            A freelance translator at the ATP 2021 Conference: Is it worth it?
        </strong>
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    This is my first post in the <strong>“Where the clients are”</strong>
    series, where I discuss and review some industry-specific talks,
    conferences, and congresses I’ve attended. As freelancers, we're told we
    should go to events like these to get to know the lingo, meet the
stakeholders, and understand the main issues of the industry. After all,    <strong>our job is to help clients address these issues</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    But there’s a catch: these events tend to be pricey and
    <strong>
        there’s no guarantee we’ll get much back from our investment
    </strong>
    , especially if we don't naturally belong to that community. This series is
    told from my perspective—that of a
    <a href="https://psytranslations.com/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        psychologist and English to Spanish freelance translator
    </a>
    —so the posts will be focused on <strong>healthcare, education, </strong>
    and<strong> psychology</strong> events and what to expect if you’re
    thinking of attending.
</p>
<p>
    My first post is about the ATP 2021 Innovations in Testing Conference,
    which was held virtually from April 27-29, 2021.The theme of this year’s
    event was<strong> “Assessment for a better world”</strong>.

    <strong>What is the ATP</strong>
<p></p>
      The
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.testpublishers.org/our-mission" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Association of Test Publishers
    </a>
(ATP) is an international non-profit organization that brings together providers of tests and assessment tools for lots of
    different contexts, for example for credentialing, educational, clinical,
    or selection purposes.
<p></p>
<p>
    The ATP focuses on standardized tests and assessments used
    to measure different skills, knowledge, and interests in these different
    contexts. It represents everyone who’s anyone in the assessment community,
from the subject matter experts (SMEs) and psychometricians who design the tests to the regulatory bodies that govern their use and scope.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="scroll-margin-top: 50px" id="anchor-2"><span></span></p>
    <strong>Who goes to the ATP Conference?</strong>
<p></p>
<p>
    The ATP organizes several events throughout the year: some
    are small (e.g., division coffee talks), some are specific (e.g., summits
    about security in testing environments), and some—like the one I
    attended—are big and broad.
</p>
<p>
    It's very easy to find out who might go to this conference: you can check
    their <a href="https://www.testpublishers.org/our-members" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our members </a>
page! Of course, not every organization from this list will attend, but it's a good starting point. Most members are organizations
    that provide assessment services as a main offering or maybe as just one
    part of their mission, related to certification in specific fields (e.g.,
    American Association of Medical Assistants).
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="scroll-margin-top: 50px" id="anchor-3"><span></span></p>
    <a><strong>ATP Conference highlights</strong></a>
<p></p>
<p>
There were many highlights, but the key discussion topic was the industry upheaval as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Testing companies have had to adapt to remote testing almost overnight in order to continue providing their
    services.
</p>
<p>
    The pandemic even made its way into more general talks, which discussed the
    huge change in practices, the legal implications (e.g., privacy rights for
    the examinees), and the more practical consequences (e.g., cheating).
</p>
<p>
    Another important topic (and here the "assessment for a better world" part
    comes into play) was the emphasis on fairness in testing,
    which is all about accommodations for people with disabilities, and
    culture-fair tests.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="scroll-margin-top: 50px" id="anchor-4"><span></span></p>
    <a><strong>What did I learn?</strong></a>
<p></p>
<p>
    Two topics particularly piqued my interest:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Culture fairness: </strong>
        as a translator, I’m interested in how adaptation can reduce or eliminate the biases surrounding a testing process. It was inspiring to hear that the assessment community is focused on
        this objective throughout the process, and not just
        when the test is already in the examinee's hands.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o I learned about different adaptation approaches from Steve Dept and his
    team. They recommend a proactive approach to cultural
    fairness right from the design phase, instead of just fixing problems as
    they arise, jeopardizing the psychometric properties of the test.
</p>
<p>
o Now that certifications and assessments are offered globally, I
also learned how important it is to think about different variants of the same language, not
    only from a purely linguistic point of view, but also from a cultural
    perspective. For example, if the test mentions a food or a sport
    that is very specific, how can this be adapted without affecting the
    psychometric properties?
</p>
<p>
o There was also an illuminating conversation about new markets (new cultures!) with Paula Baciu, who
    discussed Latin America, Asia, and other markets not usually covered in
    talks.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Accommodations: </strong>
as a psychologist, I've worked in the field of inclusive education, specifically providing support on
        accommodations to faculty members and higher-education students. It was
        encouraging to see how providers take this aspect seriously when
        designing and administering tests.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
o I learned about the application of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
    from John Hosterman, Donald Balasa, and Heather Case.
</p>
<p>
o I found out more about the effect of anxiety in test takers and how to provide
    accommodations from Benjamin Lovett.
</p>
<p>
o I saw how easy changes can make a difference for certain conditions, like using <a href="https://opendyslexic.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">special fonts</a> for people with dyslexia, from Kathryn Owens and Ben
    Brady.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="scroll-margin-top: 50px" id="anchor-5"><span></span></p>
    <strong>What’s in it for a freelance translator?</strong>
<p></p>
<p>
There were some topics of general interest even if you don't know much about the industry, but they
    were the exception rather than the rule. I would approach this event mainly
as an opportunity to learn more about the industry, to get to know the issues your potential clients are facing.
</p>
<p>
    It’s also important to know that most attendees belong to organizations
    (big and small) and there are few individuals without affiliations to these
    (like in my case).
</p>
<p>
    <u>Is it too technical?</u>
</p>
<p>
    I don’t think so. There are some talks that go into the specifics of psychometrics, and
    where you may need some fundamentals; but fear not, the conference team
    sends the recordings afterward, so you can(re)watch and learn at your own
    pace.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, the conference had a good balance between long presentations and
brief and dynamic discussions; as a result, it wasn’t monotonous and it was easy to switch between
    them.
</p>
<p>
    <u>How was the networking?</u>
</p>
<p>
    They had their own app with an integrated feed. That way,
    you could post there if you didn't fancy doing it on social media. There
    were also hashtags like #atpconf, so you could check what others were
    saying about the event.
</p>
<p>
    The app included a handy list of attendees who could be contacted directly
    from there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="scroll-margin-top: 50px" id="anchor-6"><span></span></p>
    <strong>My top takeaway</strong>
<p></p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        Test anxiety is something that most of us experience (e.g., 30-50% of
        college students) to different degrees, and although we may think
        intuitively that performance could be greatly affected by it, it seems
        the
        <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1044207317710699" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            association is not that clear-cut.
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Accommodations to address anxiety are designed to make the situation
        more comfortable for the person.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>In summary</strong>
    <br>
</p>
<p>
    The ATP 2021 Conference was a great experience for me. I
now have a better understanding of the whole assessment process and
    of what’s important to people along the different parts of the chain.
    Before, I had a more fragmented view as a test user (as a psychologist) and
    as part of the test adaptation process (as a translator).
</p>
<p>
    I still need to watch some of the discussions I couldn't attend, so the
    learning continues!
