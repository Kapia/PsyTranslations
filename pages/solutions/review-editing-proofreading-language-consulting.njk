        <p class="mb-3 ">
You already have a Spanish text, but need to make sure everything is up to par and that it’s going to be appropriate, not only from a linguistic angle, but also a cultural one.

          </p>

        <p class="mb-3 ">
This is even more important when the texts have to follow specific considerations, like when they’re related to medical or healthcare topics, when they appear on websites or apps, or when they’re part of tests and assessments.

          </p>

        <p class="mb-3 ">
It’s possible your text already checks out regarding terminology and content because it’s been written by subject-matter experts, but you still want to 
<b>make sure it shines and fulfills its aim.</b>
          </p>

        <p class="mb-3 ">
For this, you need a guarantee of its excellency from a linguistic standpoint. After all, nothing damages your reputation in the eyes of your readers, users, patients, and potential clients as much as typos, convoluted sentences, lack of cohesion, inadequate terms, or confusing writing.
          </p>

        <p class="mb-3 ">
If we work together, I can also offer an external review from a second reviewer (on request) for extra assurance and compliance with ISO 17100:2015 workflow.

Regardless of whether your Spanish material was originally written in Spanish or in English, I can help you correct, standardize, and streamline it, producing content that’s fit-forpurpose, cohesive, coherent, and error-free
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3 ">

I can help you with:

<ul class="has-text-left">
  <li>&bull; Ensuring the style is consistent throughout</li>
  <li>&bull; Adapting texts to your required standards (e.g., bias-free language)</li>
  <li>&bull; Eliminating errors</li>

</ul>

          </p>
          <p class="mt-3 mb-3 ">
If your material has been translated into Spanish, it also needs to be checked against the
English source text to ensure it’s a faithful rendering of the original.

The job of an item editor goes beyond what a simple editing and proofreading task entails, as it calls for a solid grasp of item writing and test construction fundamentals, as well as knowledge of Spanish language standards as they apply to the assessment context

That is—it follows the latest updates in the Spanish language and is flawless. Rely on a Spanish language specialist who also gets the clinician’s point of view.
