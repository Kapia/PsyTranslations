            <strong>Website and app localization</strong>
        </h1>

        <p class="mb-3 ">
The Spanish-speaking market is a force to be reckoned with. There are more than 496 million speakers and 21 official Spanish-speaking countries. And then there’s the United States, home to the second-highest number of Spanish speakers.
          </p>

        <p class="mb-3  ">
You want to reach them, and you know the theory. The internationalization and localization of software, applications, and website content aims to preserve the app’s original intent, so your new users feel it’s designed exclusively for them.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3  ">
But in practice, this encompasses all kinds of decisions regarding adapting to other cultures and languages, handling specific tools (like content management systems), knowing SEO, and being familiar with the specific environment of websites and applications.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3  ">
And that’s not all: If your app or website is a digital health technology that supports healthcare and medical practice, additional regulatory requirements might apply. 
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3  ">
For these reasons and more, trust a translator with experience in healthcare/medical and technology topics. Someone who can help you make decisions, making for an easier localization process.
        </p>

            <strong>Localization of websites and apps </strong>
        </h1>
          <p class="mb-3 ">
Localizing your website, app, or software means making decisions that require detailed knowledge of the target market.            
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3 ">
English and Spanish might have many common features (like our alphabet), but there are many specific cultural differences that can make your users feel confused if left unaddressed. Think currencies, time and date formats, measurement systems, taboos, gender issues, and many other aspects.            
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3 ">
Work with a translator familiar with the localization technologies you already use (or plan on using) and who takes it in their stride when you mention HTML tags or a new platform. Someone who can help you offer your users localized Spanish content that will make them feel welcome and comfortable.

            <strong> Localization of mobile medical apps </strong>
        </h1>

        <p class="mb-3 ">
Some mobile health (mHealth) technologies fall into the category of mobile medical apps (MMAs), software that meets the definition of a medical device. 
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3 ">
They are therefore subject to the same rigorous regulations as any other medical device. In the EU, the requirements include a mandatory accurate translation for a national market in order to get the CE marking. If your app is an MMA (which includes digital therapeutics or DTx), a faulty translation has the potential to cause injuries or unintended results.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3 ">
Because it combines the interactive nature of an app and the accuracy of a medical device, the localization of your MMA app requires not only a professional with experience in website and app localization, but one with a specific background as a medical translator. 
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3 ">
With the rise of DTx for mental health, relying on a

is almost a must!

            <strong>Localization of lifestyle and wellness apps </strong>
        </h1>
          <p class="mb-3 ">
Another category of mHealth (and the most popular one at that) is general wellness products that have lifestyle and well-being purposes, but don’t qualify as medical devices. 
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3 ">
But that doesn’t mean you take your app any less seriously. On the contrary—being free of the strict regulations can help you focus on the engagement and interactivity that apps in other categories might lack. 
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3 ">
Got an app specialized in helping users maintain a healthy lifestyle, manage stress, and preserve their emotional well-being? Then you’ll benefit from the services of a translator who gets how to follow guidelines, prioritize engagement, and integrate with your team.
